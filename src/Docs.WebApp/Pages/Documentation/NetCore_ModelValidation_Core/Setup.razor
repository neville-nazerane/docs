            This library provides functionalities that help add and retrieve error messages that are maintained in internal
            dictionaries. The purpose is to allow certain error messages to be added within class libraries that can
            later be leveraged within .net core web apps or to get and verify errors in unit tests. The
            <DocLink Document="NetCore.ModelValidation" /> package helps link these error messages with the <code>ModelState</code>
            in .NET Core web projects.
        </p>

        <p>
            All error messages can be managed using an instance of the <code>ModelValidator</code>
            class. A new instance can be created with its default constructor or using dependency injection.
            Dependency injection can preferably be set as a scope so as to manage errors within the current scope.
            To add it as a service, the helper function <code>services.AddNetCoreValidations()</code>
        </p>

            To start using model validaitons as a service, make sure to add the service
            to the service collection:
        </p>

        <CSharp>services.AddNetCoreValidations()</CSharp>

        <p>
            Once this is added, the class <i>ModelValidator</i> can be injected into any service. The following
            sections of this documentation explains on the usage of the injected <i>ModelValidator</i> object.
