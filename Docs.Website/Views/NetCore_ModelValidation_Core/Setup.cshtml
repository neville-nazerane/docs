    To start using model validaitons as a service, make sure to add the service 
    to the service collection:
</p>

<pre><code>services.AddNetCoreValidations()</code></pre>

<p>
    Once this is added, the class <i>ModelValidator</i> can be injected into any service. The following 
    sections of this documentation explains on the usage of the injected <i>ModelValidator</i> object.
