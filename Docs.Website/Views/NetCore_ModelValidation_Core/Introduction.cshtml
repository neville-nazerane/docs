    This package allows you to manage error validations across services. These errors can be added and retrieved in 
    the following ways:

    <ol>
        <li>A simple error not mapped to anything</li>
        <li>
            An error mapped to a string (a key) which is expected to be the property name. Helper functions
            also allow you to pass the key as lamda expressions for safety.
        </li>
        <li>
            Error messages can also be mapped to a model (an object). Furthermore, messages can be mapped to a model 
            and it's property (a string), which can once again be used with the help of lamda expressions. 
        </li>
    </ol>

    These errors can thus be
